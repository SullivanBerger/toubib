# Toubib - An Imaginary Medical Appointment Platform

As a new frontend developer, I've embarked on a side project called Toubib to enhance my skills. The aim is to develop a medical appointment platform with the following features:

- Listing doctors
- Searching for specialized doctors
- Making appointments

Initially, my focus will be on the frontend, utilizing data from a JSON file. Here are the key areas I intend to improve:

- Getting more comfortable with Nuxt 3
- Implementing better TypeScript practices
- Exploring Nuxt UI
- Advanced usage of Pinia
- Exploring testing with Vitest

Ultimately, I aim to make this project exemplary, allowing me to showcase it in my future portfolio.
